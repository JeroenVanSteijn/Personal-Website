### About me

My name is Jeroen van Steijn, a web/mobile and DevOps consultant. Currently, I work as technical lead at [Bytecode Digital Agency B.V.](https://bytecode.nl), an agency I co-founded.

#### Career

I started programming when I was quite young. In 2009 I created my first website, but from 2014 on I started working as a developer professionally.

I first started my professional career freelancing, under the name of Nooijen/Van Steijn Web Solutions together with Luciano Nooijen. The amount of projects grew rapidly, and soon I had to involve other freelancers to help me out.

After a few years during which business kept growing, Luciano and I decided to join forces and co-found an agency. We started Bytecode Digital Agency, Bytecode for short.

#### Education

In 2017 I finished VWO, the highest level of Dutch high school. Afterwards, I followed some Computer Science and Engineering courses at Delft University of Science.

#### Courses

In 2016 I became Anglia Proficiency certified, graded "Distinction". This implies that I can speak, read and write on at least C1 level ("effective operational proficiency or advanced") on the [CEFRL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) scale.
